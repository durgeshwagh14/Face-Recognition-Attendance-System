A simple and fast **Face Recognition–Based Attendance System** built with **Streamlit**. It detects faces through webcam and automatically records attendance in Excel files.

## ⭐ Features

streamlit run app.py
```

## 📝 How It Works

1. Open the app
2. Go to **Mark Attendance**
3. Show your face to the camera
4. Attendance is saved automatically in `attendance/`

## ➕ Add New Faces

* Use the **Register New Face** option
* Or add images manually to `known_faces/PersonName/`

Generated daily as:

```
Attendance_YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx
```
